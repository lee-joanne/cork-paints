* ### Design
  - Colour Scheme

    1. Purple (#78748F)
    2. White (#fff)
    3. Black (#232222)

    - The main colours I have selected for this website are purple (#78748F), white (#fff), and black (#232222). For white text with the purple background, I have added 0.8 opacity to make the solid colour less harsh but also to increase readability for the user. These colours work beautifully together and white fonts are used on top of purple backgrounds and black font is used on top of white backgrounds. 

  - Typography

    1. Montserrat
    2. Lora
    3. Sans Serif (fallback)

    - The main fonts used are Montserrat and Lora, with Sans Serif used as the fallback font. Montseratt is a sans-serif typeface used for headings throughout the website for high readability when the user is browsing the page. The eyecatching nature of the font is perfect for high level headings because the font is very eyecatching so the users will know exactly what each heading represents. Lora is a gorgeous serif font used for paragraphs and lower level headings. Lora is chosen for it's attractive typography to explain the main details of the website. 

  - Imagery

    - The hero image contains a gorgeous photo of a hand painting on a canvas, with colours that highly suit the colour scheme of the website. The image contains a keyframe to zoom in to catch the user's attention. The images chosen are selected to be minimalistic and artistic which suit the painting theme of Cork Paints.

* ### Wireframes
  - Wireframes have been created using the program Sketch.

## Features

* ### Existing Features

  - Navigation Bar
    - Featured on all three pages, the full navigation bar which is viewed on desktop and large devices shows the logo on the left hand side with an icon from Font Awesome which matches the colour scheme. On the right hand side, 'Home', 'Courses', and 'Register' are added to allow the user to easily direct themselves around the website. The links are consistent in text and size to allow for easy navigation.

    - The page that is currently active is coloured purple (#78748F) for the user to understand which page they are on. When the user hovers over the links, the links change to purple (#78748F) to help the user confirm which link they are about to click.

    - When the device screens go smaller (tablet and mobile sizes), the navigation bar will turn into a hamburger icon. The hamburger icon is perfect for more breathing space between the navigation bar and logo for the users to redirect themselves to a different page. The hamburger icon is great for intuitive navigation as users will easily recognize the hamburger icon's purpose.

    - The about section contains a paragraph of text and a circular image. The h3 heading is in purple (#78748F) to match the colour scheme of the website and the text is in black to contrast the white background. The text explains who Cork Paints is to allow the users to understand who is behind Cork Paints. This allows the users to feel more connected to the people behind Cork Paints by humanizing the website. 

    - The circular image contains a woman's face behind a painted piece of glass to represent the volunteers of Cork Paints to enhance the aesthetics of this section.

    - An iFrame is included in this section for the user to know exactly where Cork Paints is located. The iFrame is from Google Maps so therefore the user is able to zoom in and out of maps and even look up the directions from their location.

  - Footer 

    - The footer contains links to the social media pages of Cork Paints, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. These links will open in a separate tab so the users will not be directed away from the website entirely. The icons are large to be highly accessible to the user.

    - When hovered, the links will become purple (#78748F) to help the user confirm which link they are about to click.

    - The footer is essential to provide more ways for the user to stay connected with Cork Paints.

  - Courses 

    - The courses page will contain information on what classes Cork Paints has to offer. The top of the page will contain links to jump to the skill level section that the user is interested in, which will come in handy on tablets or mobile phones to minimize scrolling.

    - The courses page consists of nine cards. The courses are organized by skill level and each skill level offers workshops in watercolour, acrylic, and oil. The cards contain information such the dates and time, price, age range, and brief descrpition of each course. The information is centered nicely and contains icons for the users to easily read the information on the cards.

  - Register 

    - The register page contains a header at the top to encourage users to register for Cork Paints. The page then contains a form where users will be able to sign up for their desired course. Users are able to input their first name, last name, and email address in the text boxes. There are two dropdown menus where users can select which skill level they wish to sign up with and the desired course.
    - The bottom of the form contains a submit button that changes to purple when hovered over to assure the user that the button is clickable.

  * ### Features Left to Implement

  - In the future, I would like to create a form where users can register for a newsletter subscription to stay intuned with updates and events.

  - I would like to create a gallery section with various types of painting made by learners in the past to inspire first time users to come and see what they are capable of learning. As well, for frequent users to come see their artwork displayed on the website.

  - I would also like to create a sign up section for learners to volunteer to be a teacher at the workshop, since the teachers are volunteers. This feature will be of great use for frequent users of the website who has gained enough skills to feel confident enough to teach lessons.

  3. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

      - Git was used by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

  5. [GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Testing

* ### Validator Testing

To thoroughly test the website, the W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validation Service were used to validate all pages of the project to spot any errors in the syntax. No errors were found for all HTML pages and the CSS file.

  - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
    - [CSS Results](assets/documentation/images/css-validator.png) 

  - [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
    - [Index Page Results](assets/documentation/images/index-validator.png) 
    - [Courses Page Results](assets/documentation/images/courses-validator.png) 
    - [Register Page Results](assets/documentation/images/register-validator.png) 

* ### Accessibility Testing

The website was also tested on Lighthouse to test accessibility. When tested, all three pages come up as 97% on accessibility. 

  - [Index Page Results](assets/documentation/images/index-lighthouse.png)
  - [Courses Page Results](assets/documentation/images/courses-lighthouse.png)
  - [Register Page Results](assets/documentation/images/register-lighthouse.png)

* ### Unfixed Bugs

  - Using Lighthouse, performance scores are low on all of the pages. In the future, I wish to be able to bring the performance score up to at least 90% to ensure that the users will be able to open up this website at ease. This issue has been left unfixed because when convering some of the images from jpeg to webp and then compressing, the quality of the images have been lost. User experience of clear images has been prioritized for now over performance speed to ensure the website is appealing to the user.
    
* ### Further Testing

  - The website has been tested on many different browsers including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Large monitors, laptops, tablets, and devices such as the iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 11, and Xiaomi Mi Note 10 have been used to check the quality of the website. 
  - Using Chrome DevTools, I have tested all of the pages on multiple different device screens to check the responsiveness of all the pages.
