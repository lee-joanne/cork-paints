* ### Design
  - Colour Scheme

    1. Purple (#78748F)
    2. White (#fff)
    3. Black (#232222)

    - The main colours I have selected for this website are purple (#78748F), white (#fff), and black (#232222). For white text with the purple background, I have added 0.8 opacity to make the solid colour less harsh but also to increase readability for the user. These colours work beautifully together and white fonts are used on top of purple backgrounds and black font is used on top of white backgrounds. 

  - Typography

    1. Montserrat
    2. Lora
    3. Sans Serif (fallback)

    - The main fonts used are Montserrat and Lora, with Sans Serif used as the fallback font. Montseratt is a sans-serif typeface used for headings throughout the website for high readability when the user is browsing the page. The eyecatching nature of the font is perfect for high level headings because the font is very eyecatching so the users will know exactly what each heading represents. Lora is a gorgeous serif font used for paragraphs and lower level headings. Lora is chosen for it's attractive typography to explain the main details of the website. 

  - Imagery

    - The hero image contains a gorgeous photo of a hand painting on a canvas, with colours that highly suit the colour scheme of the website. The image contains a keyframe to zoom in to catch the user's attention. The images chosen are selected to be minimalistic and artistic which suit the painting theme of Cork Paints.

## Features

* ### Existing Features

  - Navigation Bar
    - Featured on all three pages, the full navigation bar which is viewed on desktop and large devices shows the logo on the left hand side with an icon from Font Awesome which matches the colour scheme. On the right hand side, 'Home', 'Courses', and 'Register' are added to allow the user to easily direct themselves around the website. The links are consistent in text and size to allow for easy navigation.

    - The page that is currently active is coloured purple (#78748F) for the user to understand which page they are on. When the user hovers over the links, the links change to purple (#78748F) to help the user confirm which link they are about to click.

    - When the device screens go smaller (tablet and mobile sizes), the navigation bar will turn into a hamburger icon. The hamburger icon is perfect for more breathing space between the navigation bar and logo for the users to redirect themselves to a different page. The hamburger icon is great for intuitive navigation as users will easily recognize the hamburger icon's purpose.
